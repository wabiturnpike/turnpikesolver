A Faster Heuristic for the Turnpike Problem with Measurement Uncertainty

# Requirements
- C++ 20+ with cmake3.4+
- C++ Dependencies: Boost, Eigen, PkgConfig

- Python3.10+
- Python Dependencies: PyBind11, SciPy

# Instructions
The TurnpikeMM library must be compiled first. To compile and setup the library:
1. run cmake from the pybind-setup
2. run make from pybind-setup/build
3. mv ./TurnpikeMM.cpython-3*-*.so ../../turnpike-solver-src

To run our synthetic tests:
- start from turnpike-solver-tests and run ./run-synthetic.sh
