# TurnpikeMM: A Paper's Code Repository

This repository contains the code implementation for the paper *A Much Faster Heuristic for Turnpike Problem with Measurement Uncertainty*. It provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up your environment, compile the required dependencies, and execute the tests. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10**: Download and install Python 3.10. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) for easy management of Python environments.
2. **C++20-compliant compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++20. Popular options include [GCC 10](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/) or later and [Clang 11](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#11.0.0) or later.
3. **Boost**: Download and install the most recent version of the [Boost C++ Libraries](https://www.boost.org/users/download/).
4. **Eigen**: Download and install the most recent version of the [Eigen C++ Library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download).

For macOS users with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), Boost and Eigen can be installed with:

<button id="copyButton"></button>
<pre><code id="codeBlock">brew install boost
brew install eigen
</code></pre>

For Ubuntu users, Boost and Eigen can be installed with:

<button id="copyButton"></button>
<pre><code id="codeBlock">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
</code></pre>

## Installation

Once you have the prerequisites installed, follow these steps to set up the TurnpikeMM project:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the TurnpikeMM repository.
2. Change directory to TurnpikeMM:
<button id="copyButton"></button>
<pre><code id="codeBlock"> cd TurnpikeMM </code></pre>
3. Install the Python package:
<button id="copyButton"></button>
<pre><code id="codeBlock"> python3.10 -m pip install -e . </code></pre>


## Running the Tests

After installing, you can run our experiments with the following:

4. Change directory to turnpike-solver-tests:
<button id="copyButton"></button>
<pre><code id="codeBlock"> cd ../turnpike-solver-tests </code></pre>

5. Run the experiment script:
<button id="copyButton"></button>
<pre><code id="codeBlock"> ./run-synthetic.sh </code></pre>

This script will run a series of tests on synthetic data, generating results and performance metrics for the TurnpikeMM algorithm. You can view the output in the terminal and/or log files generated by the script.

## Use
You only need one thing to use the solver: a distance set. It is helpful to have a rough estimate of the distance set's uncertainty, but the estimate only improves runtime. Just set a sufficiently high threshold (e.g., as large as your largest distance) if you don't have one. 

To solve a Turnpike instance,

<button id="copyButton"></button>
<pre><code id="codeBlock">from TurnpikeMM.worker import solve 
z = solve(d, uncertainty)
</code></pre>

The vector z is the method's point vector estimate. It satisfies the symmetry-breaking constraints detailed in the paper.
