# TurnpikeMM: A Paper's Code Repository

This repository contains the code implementation for the paper *A Much Faster Heuristic for Turnpike Problem with Measurement Uncertainty*. It provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up your environment, compile the required dependencies, and execute the tests. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10**: Download and install Python 3.10. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) for easy management of Python environments.
2. **C++20-compliant compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++20. Popular options include [GCC 10](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/) or later and [Clang 11](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#11.0.0) or later.
3. **Boost**: Download and install the most recent version of the [Boost C++ Libraries](https://www.boost.org/users/download/).
4. **Eigen**: Download and install the most recent version of the [Eigen C++ Library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download).

## Installation

Once you have the prerequisites installed, follow these steps to set up the TurnpikeMM project:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the TurnpikeMM repository.
2. Change directory to the `TurnpikeMM` subfolder: `cd TurnpikeMM`
